# digital-catalogue
For the creation of Loughborough2018_'s digital catalogue

This repository was created for the building of the Loughborough2018_ digital catalogue, a collaboration between @Raudhir and @dangithub96.

Mission statement:
To provide an accessible platform which invites visitors of the exhibition(s)—and those interested souls after the fact—to explore the range of exhibited work by Loughborough students with the aim of potential employers making enquiries.
